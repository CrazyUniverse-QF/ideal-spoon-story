Once upon a time there is a man called Cui. He was a profound student in the cs 4000 class in UC Davis. The teacher at the CS 4000 class at UCD is a old witch, it seems to be scaring, but students say she grades mercifully at students. However, Mr Cui, at his first class, noticed something wrong. Compared to the 3000  he completed there are much more assignments to do. He is sacred.
Last Friday, Cui missed the early submission for the Red-Black Tree program. He was so frustrated. He tried so hard to finish all the requirements from the instructor, but RBT was just hard to implement. The algorithm was more complicated than AVL. He emailed the instructor to make an appointment about how to succeed in this class. The appointment would be after the Spring break.
This week,although Cui had tons of assignments to be done.He spent some time reviewing the midterm.But he still did not well due to his careless.He was so depressed.He noticed that he may not get a great score in the end.He even want to drop the class.On the other hand,he was looking forward to the appointment with the instructor seeking for help.He thought he may be inspired,know the secret of becoming perfect and improve himself finally.However,unluckily,the COVID-19 came,all the class would be online,he had no idea if the appointment would be delayed or cancelled.
