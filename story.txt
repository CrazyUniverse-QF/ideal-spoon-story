Once upon a time there is a man called Cui. He was a profound student in the cs 4000 class in UC Davis. The teacher at the CS 4000 class at UCD is a old witch, it seems to be scaring, but students say she grades mercifully at students. However, Mr Cui, at his first class, noticed something wrong. Compared to the 3000  he completed there are much more assignments to do. He is sacred.
